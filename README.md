This is the CS108 Final Project. Suppose to simulate a character wiki, but with Beyblades where you could look up and find information on a specific beyblade depending on the characteristics. This is incomplete due to time management issues.

Beyblade.java - holds the setters and getters for the beyblades
Beylogger.java - creates the beylocker or beybladeList that stores the beyblades
BeySpecifics,java - Interface that holds special values specific to each beyblade
Blader.java - abstract class - gets userInput for user to create a Blader Profile
BladerProfile.java - runs the wiki/game with the main method
beyblade.csv - csv file that holds the information of all the Beyblades
